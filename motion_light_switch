blueprint:
  name: Motion Light Switch (with daylight & self-healing timeout)
  description: |
    Turns lights on when motion is detected and off when no motion after delay.
    Adds optional daylight sensor (skip lighting if bright) and a self-healing
    timeout that turns lights off if they remain on for too long with no motion.
